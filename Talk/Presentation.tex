% For a 20-25 minute senior seminar talk you probably want something like:
% - Two or three major sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should probably be between
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\subsection{Data Sets - KDD99 and RLD09}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{KDD99}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generated by simulating a military network environment in 1999.
		\item Has long been a standard data set for intrusion detection.
		\item Data in the set is classified as normal or attack activity.
		\item KDD99 uses 41 features.
		\begin{itemize}
		  	\item \emph{Features} are properties of a \emph{record}, (either an attack or normal activity), that are used to describe the activity.
		\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Some Features of KDD99}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item duration: length of the normal or attack activity
in seconds.
		%\item src\_bytes: number of bytes sent from source to destination.
		\item num\_failed\_logins: number of failed login attempts.
		\item root\_shell: returns 1 if root shell is obtained, else returns 0.
		%\item num\_access\_files: number of operations on access control files.
		%\item srv\_count: number of connections to the same service as the current connection in the past two seconds.
		\item serror\_rate: percentage of connections that have ``SYN" errors.
		%\item same\_srv\_rate: percentage of connections to the same service.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{RLD09}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RLD09 was created because KDD99 is 14 years old.
		\item Data was captured from a university in Bangkok, Thailand.
		\item The data has 10 million data packets, 17 different types of attacks (divided into denial of service and probe attacks), and 12 features.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Rules}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Rules}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Elements of one set are separated into different sets in order to differentiate between normal connections and attacks.
		\item If-Then format
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If the length of the activity is 4 seconds, then the probability of it being an attack is 100\%.
		\end{itemize}
